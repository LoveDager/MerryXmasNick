# Dear Sir Nicholas,

I wanted to send you something nice as thank you for all the chaos I've brought you this year with Dream for Earth. I know it was a lot and I was pushing the limits of what one can ask of a friend. I really hope it hasn't hurt our friendship in the end. 🥲

So, over to the gift! 🎁

This is (if you ask me) a really cool speaker. They are made by a small company in Stockholm, started by only two guys who I met a couple of years ago. I have had my transparent speaker in my living room since then and I still consider it one of my favorite things.

Their philosophy is to take scandinavian simplicity and make a speaker that literaly blends in with the room, hence it is transparent. As you said you liked Stockholm when you were here, I thought I'd give you a bit of Stockholm to keep. I hope you like it!

# Merry Christmas Nick!
